      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Weng Futian is a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Medicine and the National Research Institute of Health and Medical Big Data at Xiamen University, as well as a member of the Data Mining Research Center at Xiamen University, under the guidance of Professor Zhu Jianping. I completed my undergraduate and master's degrees at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central South University, and joined the Data Mining Research Center at Xiamen University in September 2021. I have published several academic papers in SCI/SSCI journals such as Expert Systems with Applications, Neural Processing Letters, Soft Computing, Journal of Digital Imaging, Annals of Biomedical Engineering, and Resources Policy. I have also written multiple working papers. I have led one undergraduate innovation and entrepreneurship project and participated in several national and provincial-level projects, including major social science projects and key projects. In addition, I serve as a reviewer for journals such as International Review of Financial Analysis, Resource Policy, Expert Systems with Applications, and Financial Innovation. My current research interests include information systems, functional data analysis, medical image processing, explainable artificial intelligence, and research on machine learning and deep learning algorithms and their applications.
